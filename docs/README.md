# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This folder contains the complete set of project management process documentation for OctoAcme. These guides ensure all team members can quickly discover, understand, and follow our workflows, roles, and quality expectations, improving onboarding and consistent project execution.

OctoAcme’s project management follows a structured lifecycle: projects move through initiation (defining problems and stakeholders), planning (breaking down deliverables and risks), execution (progressing work via standardized boards, standups, PR workflows, and frequent demos), release (using checklists for safe deployment and verification), and retrospective (continuous improvement after each milestone). Each stage is guided by a set of templates, checklists, and clear roles to ensure clarity and accountability.

Core roles include Project Managers (orchestrate delivery and communication), Product Managers (define success and prioritize value), Developers (implement, test, and document), QA/Testing (ensure quality and acceptance), and Stakeholders (input and approval). Regular communication — via daily or twice-weekly standups, weekly PM/Product syncs, and milestone stakeholder updates — keeps everyone aligned. Risks and escalations are managed transparently, with documented paths from team triage up to sponsors for critical issues.

Quality assurance is built into every workflow step: all changes require code reviews, linkage to tracked work, comprehensive automated and manual tests, and adherence to acceptance criteria. Post-release retrospectives turn lessons learned into actionable improvements, closing the loop on process evolution.
